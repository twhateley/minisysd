# Overview
This is a hoby project, and not suitable for anything.
Maybe it will be useful some day, but it is not this day.

# Features
- container PID-1 signal handling & reaping
- stdout/stderr relay to host
- no configuration, sensible defaults
- subset of systemd unit files for process management
